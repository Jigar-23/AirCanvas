# AirCanvas
Air canvas helps to draw on a screen just by maneuvering your finger fitted with a
colourful point or a simple coloured cap. I have used computer vision
techniques of OpenCV to build this project. The preferred language is python due
to its exhaustive libraries and easy to use syntax but understanding the basics it
can be implemented in any OpenCV supported language.
